# Ashley's Notes

## PREFACE

- Ancient Greek Philosophy => physics, ethics, logic
  - Rational Knowledge: Formal Philosophy, Material Philosophy
    - Formal Philosophy:
      - logic
    - Material Philosophy:
      - physics, laws of nature, "theory of nature"
      - ethics, laws of freedom, "theory of morals"

^^ the above makes more sense in a diagram, see the image included in this folder

**LOGIC CAN HAVE NO EMPIRICAL PART**
i.e. universal and necessary laws cannot be derived from experience

=> **HOWEVER**, natural and moral philosophy, "material philosophies" **CAN BE EMPIRICAL**
  - in fact, they must be empirical

Q: What does Kant mean by `object`?
Q: What is `Pure Philosophy`? What is `metaphysics`? Kant says `metaphysics is two-fold - Explain.

- Metaphysics of Nature: empirical and rational parts
- Metaphysics of Morals: also 2 parts
  - empirical: Practical Anthropology
  - ratonal: Morals, Proper

**SPECIALIZATION IS IMPORTANT**
we cannot mix the rational and the empirical

- we must put metaphysics first
- we must purify metaphysics of all empiricism

because we want to know **HOW MUCH CAN PURE REASON ACHIEVE?**
in fact, this is the most important question

**the obligation to follow laws MUST be grounded in pure reason in order to hold**

PRACTICAL RULE vs MORAL LAW (moral law must be a priori)

- laws are enforced by JUDGEMENT, which is empirical
- man is capable of pure reason but is not great at using it to control his conduct

Q: Why does Kant think a metaphysics of morals is necessary?

Q: "for the sake of the law" <- why and what does this mean?

Q: Who is Kant chastising re: mixing empiricism and pure philosophy and calling it
moral philosophy?

PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY (Wolff) <- tl;dr this shit is just psychology

Q: `Source` and `origin` are important, what does Kant mean by them?

Kant will tackle pure speculative reason first, then pure practical reason

The goal is a search for a foundation of a **SUPREME PRINCIPLE OF MORALITY**
