# FIRST SECTION
> Transition from "Common Sense" Knowledge of Morals to the Philosophical

## SUMMARY

1. The only purely good thing is good will
2. Good will is good in and of itself
3. Instinct is focused on ends and means
4. Instinct is opposed to reason
5. Good will must therefore depend on reason
6. Good will creates purpose
7. Purpose(Reason) is opposed to Happiness(Instinct)

## NOTES

- The only purely good thing is GOOD WILL
- Even the best qualities can become bad in the absense of good will (bad will)

"Worthiness to be happy" is predicated on good will (explored a lot more later)

** GOOD WILL IS GOOD IN AND OF ITSELF **
__NOT__ because of the effects and ends it motivates and has

"Usefulness or fruitlessness can neither diminish or augment its worth."

INSTINCT (nature; ENDS/MEANS oriented)
vs
REASON (contemplate existence; not guide it)

>> One might observe: MORE reason === LESS happiness
this has led to MISOLOGY, "hate of reason"

What we really need to realize is that HAPPINESS is NOT the AIM, but PURPOSE
(a lot more on this later)

REASON serves to create a will good in itself because it is not ENDS/MEANS oriented

=> therefore it follows that reason and its cultivation would reduce or
obliterate the possibility of HAPPINESS because it creates PURPOSE

Kant's method: "bring to light" via the concept of DUTY

Q: What is `duty`? Give a "good" example and a "bad" one.
(where bad means that it appears to be duty but is not)

Q: Compare `duty` to a modern religious sense of the term.

DUTY (can be commanded) vs INCLINCATION (cannot be commanded)

### PROPOSITIONS OF MORALITY

1. "To have genuine moral worth an action must be done from duty,"
2. Moral worth is not by object but by MAXIM
3. "Duty is the necessity to do an action from respect for LAW."

#### 2:

MORAL VALUE is not of "objects"
=> it depends on the "principle of the volition by which the action is done."

#### 3:

**RESPECT**

one cannot respect inclination: only approve or love

one can respect:

- "connected to will as GROUND not CONSEQUENCE"
- does NOT serve inclination, in fact "excludes", "overpowers" it

== LAW

**if i can respect it, it can be commanded"

PURE RESPECT FOR PURE LAW <- MAXIM
"follow even if it thwarts all inclinations"

K: WHAT KIND OF LAW CAN DETERMINE WILL W/O REFERENCE TO EXPECTED RESULT?
(cuz that's the only way will can be called 100% good)

** UNIVERSAL CONFORMITY TO LAW "AS SUCH" **
"I ought never act in such a way that I could not also will that my maxim 
should be universal law"

** PRINCIPLE OF THE WILL **
I conform to law, strictly, regardless of particular law
(because otherwise "duty" is a vain chimerical concept)

e.g. i could will the white lie but not a universal law to white lie

CAN I WILL THAT MY MAXIM BECOME UNIVERSAL LAW?

"duty is the condition of a will good in itself, whose worth transcends
everything."

"[T]he most remarkable thing about ordinary human understanding it
its practical concern is that it may have as much hope as any 
philosopher of hitting the mark."

however, common sense doesnt work because there is a "natural dialectice"
between

- knowing + respecting duty
- feeling inclination

******* THEREFORE ********

we are IMPELLED on **PRACTICAL** (not SPECULATIVE) GROUNDS TOWARDS PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY

we are impelled like this to avoid the opposing claims between reason and instinct
and the eventual equivocation that could occur if we let the dialectic become productive

we need to "seek aid in philosophy"

OUR PHILOSOPHICAL TASK IS A "COMPLETE CRITICAL EXAMINATION" OF OUR REASON
