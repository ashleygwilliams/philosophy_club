spiritual matters should themselves be immature, is an absurdity which
amounts to making absurdities permanent." Explain this point and 
relate it back to his beliefs about enlightenment.
- Kant says, "One age cannot enter into an alliance on oath to put the
next age in a position where it would be impossible for it to extend

Enlightenment, as it is characterized in this essay, are?
- At the beginning of the essay, Kant says, ""The motto of
enlightenment is therefore: 'Sapere aude!' Have courage to use your

as you like and about whatever you like, but obey!" Based on Kant's
characterization, do you condier yourself enlightened? Do you consider
this age enlightened? Do you think enlightenment, as understood by
Kant, is desirable? Explain why or why not.
